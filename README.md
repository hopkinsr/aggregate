aggregate
=========

IMPORTANT: Currently in development. There will almost definitely be breakages
and out-of-date documentation before the first release of this as a proper
Racket package.

A Racket library which implements and provides a Racket generics interface
for SQL-style aggregate operations, as well as common operations to group
values Mathematica-style.
